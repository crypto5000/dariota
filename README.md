# Dariota: Decentralized Augmented Reality using IOTA

Dariota is currently under development. The key insight:

> Latitude and longitude geo-coordinates can be deterministically mapped to IOTA addressses.
> Storing data in the Tangle === storing data at a location.

This implies that you can connect a GPS system (a smartphone/etc) to the IOTA Tangle and use the IOTA data layer to map elements to locations. So imagine having an augmented reality data layer using IOTA at every location on Earth.

Use cases:
* Virtual tours: you can pin facts to a location or read about facts at a location. Facts are stored in the Tangle and display based on lat/long coordinates.
* Messages/chat: you can leave messages as data for people at locations. People can read messages at locations.
* Decentralized yelp: you can leave reviews for businesses at locations. You can read reviews at locations.
* Games: think Pokemon Go, but with IOTA. Treasure hunts at locations.
